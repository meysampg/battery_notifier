# Battery Notifier :battery::notes:

This is a simple application which send notification about battery status to notification daemon (with `notify-send` command). Personally I wanna develop this tool for using as a widget on [burik666/yagostatus](https://github.com/burik666/yagostatus) :wink:.



## Usage :construction_worker:

* `-d`: enable verbose mode
* `-p`: path for battery device on `upower` command
* `-t`: threshold of critical condition (battery low border)
